# Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024][1] mysteries.

All solutions are from me, without any help. There's no shame in getting help - but I like the challenge. The initial solutions are usually messy and take longer to run, the ones here are refactored and optimized.

As [requested][2] by [Eric Wastl][3], the creator of Advent of Code, the repository doesn't contain any inputs.

My statistics (I'll never make it on the leaderboard ðŸ˜€):
